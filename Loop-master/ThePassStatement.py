# pass is a null statement for when a statement is required by Python syntax (such as within the body of a for or
# while loop), but no action is required or desired by the programmer. This can be useful as a placeholder for code
# that is yet to be written.

for x in range(10):
    pass

# In this example, nothing will happen. The for loop will complete without error, but no commands or code will be
# actioned. pass allows us to run our code successfully without having all commands and action fully implemented.
# Similarly, pass can be used in while loops, as well as in selections and function definitions etc.
while x==y:
    pass
