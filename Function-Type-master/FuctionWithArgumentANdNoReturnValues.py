# Python Function with Arguments, and NO Return Value

def Multiplication(a,b):
    Multi=a*b
    print("After Calling the Function:",Multi)
Multiplication(10, 20)

# We called the Multiplication function with different values, and it is giving the output as per the values.
# Within the Multiplication(a, b) function, We declared the variables of Multi, and also, we also had (a, b) arguments in the function. It means this function allows the user to pass 2 values.

# In the next line, we added both a and b using an Arithmetic operator ( * )


# Multi = a * b
# In the next line, the print statement is to print the output.

# print("After Calling the Function:", Multi)
