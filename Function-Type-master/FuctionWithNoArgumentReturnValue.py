# In this type of function in Python, While defining, declaring, or calling the function, We won’t pass any arguments to the function. This type of Python function won’t return any value when we call the function.
# Whenever we are not expecting any return value, we might need some print statements as output. In such a scenario, we can use this type of functions in Python.

def Adding():
    a=20
    b=30
    Sum=a+b
    print("After calling the function:",Sum)
Adding()

# If you observe the Addition() Function, We haven’t passed any arguments /parameters to the function Addition()

# We declared the integer variables a, b, and assigned 20 to a and 30 to b. In the next line, we calculate the sum using Arithmetic operator ( + )

#     a = 20
#     b = 30
#     Sum = a + b
# The below Python print statement is to print the output. Whenever we call the Adding() function, it prints the same output because a and b have fixed values inside the function.

# print("After Calling the Function:", Sum)
