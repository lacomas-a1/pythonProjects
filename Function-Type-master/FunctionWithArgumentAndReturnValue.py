# This type of function in the Python program allows the user to enter 2 integer values. Then, we pass those values to the user-defined function to add those values and return the value using the return keyword.

# Python Function with Arguments, and Return Value

def Addition(a,b):
    Sum=a+b
    return Sum
#We are calling the function Outside the Function Defination
print("After Calling the Function:",Addition(25, 45))


# Within the Addition(a, b) function, We declared the variables of Sum, and also, we also had (a, b) arguments in the function. It means this function allows the user to pass 2 values. In the next line, we added both a and b using an Arithmetic operator (+)
#  )

# Sum = a + b
# In the next line, the print statement is to print the output.

# print("After Calling the Function:", Sum)
# As you can see from the above output, we called the addition function with different values, and it is giving the output as per the values.
