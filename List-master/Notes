What is a List in Python?
The Python List is one of the most useful sequences in real-time. A Python list is a sequence of multiple values in an ordered sequence. Unlike Strings, it allows us to store different types of data such as integer, float, string, etc.

How to declare Python Lists
There are several ways to create a List in Python. The most straightforward way is to place the required items within a square bracket [ ].


How do you create an Empty List?
An object that contains no values or elements is an empty. By placing an empty square bracket create an empty list in python.

ListName = []

How to create a Python List of Different Data Types?
The first statement is an integer of five integer values. The second statement is a string that contains three String values or three words.


IntegerList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

StringList = [‘apple’, ‘Orange’, ‘Grape’, ‘Mango’]

Python lists allow placing different data types in a single. It is an example of a mixed, which contains one integer, float, and the two integer values.


MixedList = [‘apple’, 2, 3.50, ‘Mango’]

How to access Python List items?
Python Lists sequentially store data (ordered). So, we can access the elements with the help of indexes. Moreover, using indexes, we can access or alter/change each item present in it separately. The syntax to access items is

ListName([IndexNumber])
