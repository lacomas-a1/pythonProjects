Python classmethod
Unlike Static Methods, classmethod in Python bound to a Class. So, we donâ€™t have to create an instance or object of a class to call this class method.

This cls allows you to access the class variables, methods, and the static methods of the class or instance.

You can define any method as this one by using the Python @ decorator or classmethod() function. Either way, it works, but it is always advisable to go for the first option. The syntax of the Python classmethod def is

Class A:
    @classmethod
    def function_name(cls, arg1, arg2,....):
         ........
         ......
You can call the class method using ClassName.MethodName or ClassName().MethodName(). Both ways will return the result.

In this section, we show how to create or define a classmethod in Python programming language using the @ decorator and () function with ex
