Python Iterator
An Iterator in Python is an Object which contains a countable number of values or elements. You can use this iterator to Traverse all those elements. The Python iterator uses the special methods called __iter__() and __next__() methods to iterate the object elements.

Python Iterator String Example

string = 'tutorialgateway'
 
for x in string:
    print(x, end = '  ')
