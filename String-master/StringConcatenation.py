# Joining or combining more than one is called as the Python string concatenation or concat. There are multiple ways to concat.


# We can use + operator to join more than one.
# By placing more than one literal, joins them automatically.
# Placing more than one inside the one and closed parentheses ()
# * operator is repeating the sentence for a given number of times. Here it is three times.

x='Tutorial'
y='Gateway'

# Using + operator
Concat=x+y
Concat1='This'+x

# Placing two Literals Together
Concat2='Tutorial''Gateway'

# Using Parentheses
Concat3=('Tutorial''Gateway')

print(Concat)
print(Concat1)
print(Concat2)
print(Concat3)

#Using *OPerator
z=x*3
print(z)
